# Weather App

## 📍 Overview

Welcome to the **Weather App**! 🌤️

This simple yet powerful web app lets you check the current weather of any city in the world. The app fetches real-time data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and displays the temperature, weather conditions, and an icon representing the weather.

With a sleek and minimalistic design inspired by retro themes, this app is a fun way to interact with JavaScript and APIs while learning about asynchronous programming, DOM manipulation, and more.
